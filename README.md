### Pre-requisites

Fundamentals of programming is a must-have, since there are coding assignments; there is no mandatory language, although lecture material will prefer C/C++/Matlab. Linear algebra, calculus and numerical methods are nice-to-have, but not essential; the key concepts will be reviewed throughout the course.
